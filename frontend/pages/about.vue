                At the intersection between modern technology and the ancestral past of our planet, our paleontological project was born in 2025. We are a team of three passionate engineers who have united our technical knowledge and our fascination for fossils to create a digital platform dedicated to paleontological research and dissemination in Colombia and around the world as a development of a final project of a postgraduate course.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mb-2 text-subtitle-1 text-overline text-decoration-underline">About the Project</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                The heart of our initiative is a comprehensive paleontological database (currently under development) that will catalog chronological and taxonomic information, physical descriptions, and fossil curiosities. This digital repository will serve not only as a tool for researchers, but also as an accessible educational resource for students, hobbyists, and the general public.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Our scope is global, seeking to establish connections between local findings and the global paleontological context, in order to integrate a community of fossil lovers and enthusiasts, where they can share ideas, images and other curious fossil data. Also with resources for fans to learn more about the animals that inhabited the planet we call Earth.
